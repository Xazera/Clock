# Clock
User input clock



//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project is a clock that takes user input, to change the time

//What did you do particularly well?

The organization was pretty good and its modular so it can be easily changed.


//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The main improvement is that this program only runs when you input and you have to keep inputting, so definitly create a way to ignore input.

//Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The loop for the input was not the best for sure and is still a work in progress.

//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The loops, functions and overall logic are used in almost all projects from here on out. 


//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


Each part of this project is seperated into a module, there is the logic, clock,timer, and output for the clock. This makes everything very readable and organized.
